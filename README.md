Pipeline Overview:

Our CI/CD pipeline is designed to automate the build, test, and deployment process for our application using AWS services. The pipeline consists of the following stages:

`	`1. Source code management: The source code for our application is stored in an AWS CodeCommit Git repository.

`	`2. Build stage: The build stage creates the artifact of the application from the source code. Here, we are using AWS CodeBuild for building the application.

`	`3. Test stage: The test stage will run the tests against the built artifact to ensure that everything is working as expected. Here, we are using AWS CodeBuild for running the tests.

`	`4. Deploy stage: The deploy stage will deploy the built and tested application to the EC2 instance. Here, we are using AWS CodeDeploy for deploying the application.

Overview of each of the phases in the buildspec.yml file: buildspec.yml file is used by AWS Code Build to build and test the source code and creates artifact.

`	`1. install: This phase contains commands that install any necessary dependencies for the build. In this case, it updates the package manager and installs Nginx using apt-get, and also installs html-validator-cli globally using npm. This phase runs once at the beginning of the build process.

`	`2. build: This phase contains commands to build the project or prepare the files for deployment. In this case, it just copies the index.html file to the appropriate location for Nginx to serve it. This phase runs after the install phase.

`	`3. test: This phase contains commands to run any tests or validation checks on the build output. In this case, it runs the html-validator command on the index.html file to validate that it is a valid HTML file. If the file is not valid, the build will fail at this point. This phase runs after the build phase.

`	`4. post\_build: This phase contains any additional commands to run after the build is complete. In this case, it just echoes a message indicating that Nginx is being configured. This phase runs after the test phase.

`	`5. artifacts: This specifies the files to include in the build artifacts. In this case, it includes all files in the project (as denoted by the \*\*/\* pattern). The artifacts are the output of the build and are typically used for deployment.



Overview of appspec.yml file: appspec.yml file which is used by AWS CodeDeploy to specify the files to be deployed and any scripts to be run during the deployment process.

`	`1. os: Specifies the operating system on which the deployment will run. In this case, it's linux.

`	`2. files: Specifies the files to be deployed during the deployment process. In this case, it's deploying all files from the source directory (/) to the destination directory (/var/www/html).

`	`3. hooks: Specifies the lifecycle event hooks to run during the deployment process. In this case, there are two hooks being used:



`		`a. AfterInstall: This hook runs after the application files have been copied to the instance. It specifies a script to be run (scripts/install\_nginx.sh) as well as a timeout (300 seconds) and user (root) for the script execution.



`		`b. ApplicationStart: This hook runs after the AfterInstall hook has completed and Nginx has been installed. It specifies a script to be run (scripts/start\_nginx.sh) as well as a timeout (300 seconds) and user (root) for the script execution.
